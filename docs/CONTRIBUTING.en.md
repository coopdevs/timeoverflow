# Contributing

Did you find a bug? Do you want to collaborate?

Process:
* Open a thread in [discourse](https://community.coopdevs.org/c/timeoverflow) to make sure whether it's a bug or a feature :wink:
* Once we understand what the bug is about and know the steps to reproduce we will create an issue in GitHub linking to the Discourse thread.
* Create a pull request to solve the issue.
* Report back to the discourse thread the bug has been solved linking to the pull request.

Visit [the getting started guide to start developing](https://github.com/coopdevs/timeoverflow/wiki/Getting-started).

## Contributing with translations

- Edit the translations directly on the [coopdevs/timeoverflow](https://www.localeapp.com/projects/10031) project on Locale.
- **That's it!**
- The maintainer will then pull translations from the Locale project and push to Github.
