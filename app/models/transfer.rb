# A time transfer between accounts.
#
# When an amount of time is to be transferred between two accounts, a
# Transfer object should be created with the following attributes:
#
# source: id or instance of the source account
# destination: id or instance of the destination account
# amount: integer amount of time to transfer
#
# Along with the transfer, two movements are created, one in each related
# account, so the total sum of the system is zero
#
